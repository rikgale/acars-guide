# HFDL

## Introduction
High Frequency Data Link (HFDL) is a data link in the high frequency range (2 - 21MHz) with virtually global coverage. HFDL is used to convey short data messages over long distances, bi-directonally between ground stations and aircraft using the [propagation effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency) of high frequency radio waves.

16 ground stations provide redundant global coverage. There are 12 bands/groups of frequencies in the HFDL range of frequenices and these are covered in more detail in the Frequenices section below

## Hardware

For a basic set up covering a couple of adjacent bands you can get up and running with a Raspberry Pi4, RTL-SDR v4 and a suitable HF antenna (e.g. MLA-30+). For more complete setups covering all bands all of the time a lot of CPU and USB bus bandwidth is required and a Raspberry Pi4/5 will not be sufficient in some usecases. (To be discussed futher - WORK IN PROGRESS)

## Frequencies

#### 12 Frequency bands.
Not all bands are active all the time and not all frequencies are in use. Consult the latest system table for current frequencies (WORK IN PROGRESS)
